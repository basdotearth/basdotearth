The IML team was tasked with implementing a new way of working for Datacare at VGZ. As part of this team I helped to bring a transition to micro-frontends and -services by developing a new platform based on Azure. I developed custom tooling using LitElement, a custom NodeJS CLI-tool, and more. The team operated as a “competence center” for these new techniques.
