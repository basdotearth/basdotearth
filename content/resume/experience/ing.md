At ING, many teams were creating internal tools that needed documentation and “How to” guides. Our team built an internal platform using LitElement components, ESNext and a NodeJS backend, where every ING team can generate their own educational content.<br><br>I was part of the team as both developer and Scrum Master. I was also a contact for users and content providers of this application.
