In November 2024 <a href="https://erik-de-bos.nl/" target="_blank">Erik</a> and I debuted our first Agile game as speakers at XP Days Benelux in Belgium. In a packed room, sixty players battled it out in teams against various Evil Stakeholders. The card game is a tool to help Developers get more comfortable with collaborating with stakeholders. We used dark humour and crowd sourced edgecases to create a tongue-in-cheeck playing style that received a lot of love on it's first debute.
