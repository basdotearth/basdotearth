NN Group pivoted their app team towards a platform-based approach. One newly formed team would work as an agency for other BU's, and another would set out to support all app-contributors with a single, dependable tech-stack. We collected and reviewed needs and wants from all stakeholders and converted them into a standard dev-toolkit, which generated deployable units that enforced the NN Ops guidelines.
