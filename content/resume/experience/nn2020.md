I worked as part of the Moonshot-team on NN’s new NOVA app, which uses the international banking standard PSD2 to help users find new insights in their expenses. Almost directly after I joined, a nation-wide lockdown was imposed.<br><br>I initiated experiments surrounding the team workflow, aimed to improve the team’s “Developer Experience”, and worked on the CI/CD. As Scrum Master I helped team members connect with other teams and each other, overcoming the daily agile challenges in a new online environment, helping them to adjust to working from home.
