I worked as part of the Moonshot-team on NN’s new NOVA app, which uses a React Native, AWS Serverless functions and the international banking standard PSD2 to help users find new insights in their expenses.<br><br>During lockdown, I initiated experiments surrounding the team workflow, aimed to improve the team’s “Developer Experience”, and worked on the CI/CD. As Scrum Master I helped team members overcome the daily agile challenges in a new online environment, and to adjust to working from home.
