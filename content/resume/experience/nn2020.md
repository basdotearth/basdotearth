I worked as part of the Moonshot-team on NN’s new NOVA app. We used React Native, an AWS “serverless” backend, and the international banking standard PSD2 to help users find new insights in their expenses.<br><br>I improved the team’s “Developer Experience” with POCs and work on the CI/CD. As Scrum Master I helped overcome the daily agile challenges in Azure DevOps.
