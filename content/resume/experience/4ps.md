4PS has developed a feature-rich ERP system, implemented at clients by their own consultants using Scrum. I was part of the team that helped train the consultants into becoming Scrum Masters and Agile Developers. Afterwards I helped onboard 4PS client "van Gelder" into Scrum by organizing a synchronized training day where three sets of Agile PSTs helped train three teams simultaniously.
