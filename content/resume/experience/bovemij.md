viaBOVAG.nl allows it's visitors to find their next car by looking through what's available at all of BOVAG's car-dealers within seconds. The Apollo team manages and maintains the platform and implements new features for both visitors and platform-managers.<br><br>Recent projects include a massive overhaul of the old MVC platform to a JS-based SSR-stack and implementing a headless CMS to shorten the workflow for content-managers. In this team I acted as the Lead Frontend Developer, in which role I aimed to improve Developer Experience and communications with the other viaBOVAG teams.
