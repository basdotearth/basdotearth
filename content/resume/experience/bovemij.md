viaBOVAG.nl helps its visitors to find their next car by looking through what's available at all of BOVAG's car-dealers within seconds. The Apollo team manages and maintains the platform and implements new features for both visitors and platform-managers.<br><br>We migrated the old MVC platform to a JS-based SSR-stack and implemented a headless CMS to shorten the workflow for content-managers. I also focussed on improving Developer Experience and TTM, as well as improving communications with the other viaBOVAG teams.
