Railway-inspectors at ProRail documented their work in Excel, a time-consuming process that was prone to errors. ProRail tasked us with quickly generating a solution that enabled inspectors to record and log their work fully digitally. Our solution was a hybrid mobile app that provided functionality to directly link photo’s to an inspection-form, and to send these forms using custom built HTML e-mails. Within three sprints our MVP was ready for testing by ProRail’s inspectors.
