TWC is a marketleader in ’Video-on-demand’ apps. Their clients include Disney, HBO, and Dutch media agencies as NOS, RTL, and Talpa. I worked on a project that connected desktop- and Smart-TV-apps to an existing backend for one of TWC's clients. Both were made up of a common core, that was extended in design and functions for specific brands. I restructured this app completely, gaining agile velocity and code readability.<br><br>I was also part of a 2 developer, 3 sprint pressure-cooker to completely rewrite the existing Smart-TV-app for RTLXL.
