Within the “OmniShop”-team I worked on a solution that replaced multiple outdated applications with one new system based on Angular, Webpack and Sass.<br><br>Next to syncing and developing functionality based on the need of KPN callcenter- and retail-employees, I supported the team by updating our build-tools and CI/CD pipeline, a NodeJS backend, and by improving automated testing.
