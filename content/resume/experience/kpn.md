Within the “OmniShop”-team I worked on a solution that replaced multiple outdated applications with one new system based on Angular, Webpack and Sass. Next to syncing and developing functionality based on the need of KPN callcenter- and retail-employees, I supported the team with updating and finetuning our buildtools and CI/CD pipeline, developing a “local backend” based on NodeJS and by working with the test-automator to make our app more open and easy to test.
