CYSO is a Managed Hosting provider on the Dutch B2B market. Next to their core-business the company started a public cloud service in 2014 using OpenStack. For these services I worked within the development team, designing and implementing new functions and interfaces. Next to this I offered support to Marketing- and Salescampaigns. Using techniques like ITCSS, BEM and a Static Webpage-builder we reduced the time needed to load our pages with 30% and greatly improved the time needed internally to design and build new pages.
