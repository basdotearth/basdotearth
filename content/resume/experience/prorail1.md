Few are aware that some of the hardware at the Dutch tracks is nearly 50 years old. All these relays were tested by hand by ProRailâ€™s subcontractors using custom built hardware and complicated administrative processes.<br><br>We developed a solution that reduced this process to five minutes, by using a hybrid mobile app and a companion desktop app. Both apps communicated seamlessly with the specialist hardware. In this project I also translated between our designers, developers and stakeholders.
