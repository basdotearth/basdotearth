As a teacher in Graphic- and Webdesign it was my responsibility to help young people with disabilities transition towards a job in graphic design. To help them better prepare for the market, we worked together with local businesses to set up a copyshop within Heliomare.<br><br>The POS-system and website were created and designed specifically to match this special target audience.
