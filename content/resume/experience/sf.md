Scrum Facilitators currently has a simple website that centres on a single sales-funnel for online and on premise Scrum training. When I started as PO, I found 9 highly engaged stakeholders with big plans for the website, but no insight into the technical stack.<br><br>I mapped the current state and existing tech debt together with our external developers and set up a roadmap that could turn the unstable foundations into a dynamic platform that could support multiple development teams.
