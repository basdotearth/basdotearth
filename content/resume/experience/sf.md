Scrum Facilitators currently has a simple website that centres on a single sales-funnel for online and on premise Scrum training. They had big plans for the website, but lacked any insight into the technical stack.<br><br>I mapped the current state and existing tech debt together with our external developers and set up a roadmap that could turn the unstable foundations into a dynamic platform that could support multiple development teams. I rewrote the SSG stack to use NextJS and improved code readability to improve the developer experience.
