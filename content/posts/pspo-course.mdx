A while ago, I mentioned my decision to pivot towards being a Product Owner on this site. In the past few projects that I worked on as a consultant, I received some delegated tasks from the POs that I worked with. I noticed that I liked these supporting roles the best. As a consultant I moved between jobs a lot, going where I was needed, whenever they needed me. But usually the teams just wanted an extra set of hands to get through a large backlog, so there was only a limited amount of expertice that you could get with the PO role.

I feel that as a consultant, you always have to get started quickly. So even when I'm hired as a Sr. Frontend Developer, I:
- Learn the lay of the land
- Identify the principal stakeholders for the team
- Notice where things hurt the most during development

That last point often comes from the things that need to be done, but nobody really wants to do. And I love those problems. You do a deep dive, come back with some little improvements, and everyone immediately notices the difference. Like replacing a flickering lightbulb, or greasing a squeeky wheel. I also really enjoy the communication with people that don't speak a word of tech. You have to act not as a translator, but more as an interpreter between two very different cultures. Both of these cultures have very different things that they find valuable and would prioritize.

I tried being a Scrum Master for a while. I've been told that I can organize a pretty good retro, but I haven't yet done the deep dive into knowledge that can facilitate real Agile improvements. But I do really want to focus on communication more than the hard skills that people usually hire me for, which is why I always ask my current Product Owner what their life is like, owning products next to us developers.

Usually, they take the time to tell me a lot about the role and the different types of work therein. At my current project, I was able to shadow my PO in meetings, picking his brain on topics that we didn't immediately align on. This was a really valuable experience for me.

To make sure that I had some more theory to inform my practice, I booked a digital PSPO course at [b-agile](https://bagile.co.uk). After I'd placed the booking I noticed that the last day of the course was actually King's Day, so I spent that day following the online course in my windowsill, looking out at people partying in the streets below. I can really recommend b-agile: everything was taken care of, communication was crystal clear, and the group that I took the course with was very diverse in background and nationality.

Our work and trainer Alex' input paid off: I later did a couple of prep-exams, followed by the real thing. **Now I am a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner**, looking for a product that would like to be owned. I am very excited to put theory into practice in the future!
