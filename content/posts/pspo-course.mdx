I've included my descision to pivot towards a role as Product Owner in the metadata for this site for some time now. It might look a bit silly if you haven't done anything to "own a product" but you have to start somewhere right?

A couple of years ago I noticed that I liked the supporting roles the best. As a consultant I moved between jobs a lot, going where I was needed, whenever they needed me. But usually the teams mostly wanted an extra set of hands to get through a large backlog, which meant that you had to get started quickly:
- Learning the lay of the land
- Identifying the principal stakeholders for the team
- Noticing where things hurt the most during development

That last point often comes from the things that need to be done, but nobody really wants to do. And I love those problems. You do a deep dive, come back with some little improvements, and everyone immediately notices the difference. Like replacing a flickering lightbulb, or greasing a squeeky wheel. Feelsgoodman. I also really enjoy the communication with people that don't speak a word of tech. You have to act not as a translator, but as an interpreter between two very different cultures. Both of which have very different things that they find valuable.

I tried being a Scrum Master for a while, but that doesn't really tickle me as much. I've been told that I can facilitate a good retro on occasion, but I find myself lacking the nose for _real_ Agile improvements. But I do really want to focus on communication more than the hard skills that people usually hire me for, which is why I asked my current Product Owner what his live was like, PO-ing with devs like us.

After he felt sufficiently assured that I wasn't trying to move into his position, he took the time to tell me a lot about his work and the different types of jobs that he had done before as a PO. After some positive feedback from our HR department, I took to shadowing him in meetings now and then, picking his brain on topics that we didn't immediately align on. This was a really valuable experience for me! _(Thanks man, I promise to leave your chairlegs where they are ðŸ˜‰)_

To make sure that I had some more theory to inform my practice, I booked a digital PSPO course at [b-agile](https://bagile.co.uk). After I'd placed the booking I noticed that the last day of the course was actually King's Day, which meant that I spent the day following the online course in my windowsill, looking out at people partying in the streets below! I can really recommend b-agile: everything was taken care of, communication was crystal clear, and the group that I took the course with was very diverse in background and nationality.

Our hard work and our trainer Alex' input paid dividents: one day I later I did a couple of prep-exams, followed by the real thing. **Now I am a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner**, looking for a product that would like to be owned. I am very excited to put theory into practice in the future!
