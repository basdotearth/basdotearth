At my place of work we have a quarterly cycle of planning and execution. I joined the company halfway through the Q2 cycle, and only just made it into the third quarter. I left the planning for Q3 early, in a rush and feeling completely overwhelmed by everything. It turned out that I'd run all of my batteries dry in the year before. This left me perpetually overworked, which triggered panic attacks. And those are pretty scary if you don't know what the hell is happening. As a result I spent most of Q3 on the sofa, a passenger in my own head, failing to read a book.

I returned to work just in time for another 3-day planning session, but this time I had the added bonus of "not being present in the room". This is a serious affliction. Many people are "not present in the room", and very few people talk about it. If you wish to contribute to people "not present in the room", please, give generously.

_(All joking aside, you'd think that after 2 years of global pandemic we'd have learnt more about distributed meetings. But as soon as we are able to get into one room together, we no longer have the time to include, well, anyone else.)_

Don't get me wrong, my colleagues are great people with big hearts and a motivation to include others in their work, but as humans in general we seem to be inclined to act at what is at hand, what we can see and sense around us. And being at the other end of a choppy video feed falls just outside of that magic circle.

During the summer I had spent some time in therapy. My long list of psychological crutches and gripes apparently included "Not wanting to be excluded", so "not being present in the room", I was in a great mood. I could not connect, I could not vocalize my feelings, I could not share cool things with my friends... I was in a bad place (with worse broadband). But my subconscious knows me better than I do myself. Halfway through day 1, I took advantage of my place on the outer rim of the meeting, and I wrote those famous words:

```bash
git init
```

I had to do _something of worth_. So while I was watching a video feed of 10 people meeting in a room, I started a new project: A new version of my resume. After some trips to google I added blog-posts and snippets to the project. And how could I make it auto-generated? If I could use the same stack as my workplace, I could feed my lessons learned straight back into work! A small idea became a rolling stone in my mind.

I started with the obligatory Google search, and I found out that my stack was actually quite popular! A lot of devs have their little walled gardens on the internet, which includes [Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com). He has a great write-up on the techniques he has used for his site, which was a great inspiration. Before the end of the planning event, I had the following shortlist:

- A personal website, with blog and resume,
- that would be served by only static files,
- generated from a MarkDownX source,
- with code snippets and a lot of room to grow.

#### The only way is up

The following weekend I wrote the code that would import the MDX files and prep my content for NextJS. Suddenly I felt back in business and was enjoying work again. After 3 months of feeling like a professional slouch, my gears had become unstuck. Now I was up in third and revving the engine! Like I had hoped, my enthousiasm carried over into the workplace, and my side-project began to act as a turbocharger for the rest of my work. _(We build a car-related website. We use laboured car-metaphors.)_

Getting out of my funk gave me the room I needed to make some changes to make my life healthier for my mind. I opted to move from consultancy work to an internal position, and poked holes into everything I took for granted. For instance, did I really want to keep renting this apartment? Certainly a lot to think about.

I've just finished another planning session, and it feels fitting that they sort of bookend my journey these last six months. It is really scary to see how easy we slip into a rhythm in our lives. We keep drumming it, on and on even when it's hurting us on a daily basis. My downtime made me reflect, but building this website gave me a chance to act. Now I have a new job, a new apartment in a new city, a new blog to write down my thoughts and a lot of new energy for 2023.
