At my place of work we have a quarterly cycle of planning and execution. I joined the company halfway through the Q2 cycle, and only just made it into the third quarter. I left the planning for Q3 early, feeling completely overwhelmed by everything. It turned out that I'd run all of my batteries dry in 2021. This left me perpetually overworked, which triggered panic attacks. _(And those are pretty scary if you don't know what's going on!)_ As a result I spent most of Q3 on the sofa, failing to read a book.

I returned to work in time for the next quartely planning session, as an off-site participant through teams. One would think that after 2 years of global pandemic we'd have learnt more about distributed meetings, but as soon as most people are able to get into one room together, they will no longer think to include people that are not directly visible in their peripheral vision. Which is why halfway through day 1, I took advantage of my place on the outside and started on this newest iteration of my resume. And like all epic journeys, it started with:

```bash
git init
```

While I was watching a choppy feed of 10 people meeting in a room, I had time to google a wishlist together: I added blog-posts and snippets to the project. And I wanted to make it auto-generated. If I could use the same stack as my workplace, I could feed my lessons learned straight back into work! A small idea started to get some track.

I found out that my stack was quite popular! A lot of devs have their little walled gardens on the internet, and that includes [Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com). He has a great write-up on the techniques he has used for his site, which was a great inspiration. Before the end of the planning event, I had the following shortlist:

- A personal website, with blog and resume,
- that would be served by only static files,
- generated from a MarkDownX source,
- with code snippets and a lot of room to grow.

#### If you build it, they will come.

The following weekend I wrote the code that would import the MDX files and prep my content for NextJS. This was a great kickstart to a fun little sideproject, that left me wit more energy and excitement for my work in the workplace as well!

My "pause" over the summer gave me the time to make some changes to my life, to keep life healthier for my mind. I opted to move from consultancy work to an internal position, and started poking holes in everything I normally took for granted. _(Like my rental apartment, which turned out to be HOT ðŸ”¥ during the summer!)_

I write this first blogpost having just finished another planning session. These PI events feel like a sort of bookend for my journey these last six months. My downtime gave me time to reflect, but building this website gave me a chance to do something fresh and find my groove again. Now I have a new job, a new apartment in a new city, a new blog to write down my thoughts and a lot of new energy for 2023.

_(But let's be real: It'll probably be two posts a year, max. Because there are so many good books to read...)_
